    "Quora is a popular website where anyone can ask and/or answer a question. There are more than 100 millions unique visitors per month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other forum, Quora is facing a problem: toxic questions and comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can imagine, Quora teams cannot check all of the Q&A by hand. So they decided to ask the data science community to help them to perform automatically insincere questions classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge was launched on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the overall information on Kaggle. Quora provided a dataset of questions with a label, and the features are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `qid`: a unique identifier for each question, an hexadecimal number\n",
    "- `question_text`: the text of the question\n",
    "- `target`: either 1 (for insincere question) or 0\n",
    "\n",
    "🔦 In this competition, the metric used for performance evaluation is the **F-score**."
